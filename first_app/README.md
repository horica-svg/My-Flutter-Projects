# My first Flutter app

This is my first Flutter app, created during an Udemy course I'm taking.

It is a very basic app that returns a random number between 1 and 6 and shows a picture of a die corresponding to the number returned. It has a single button that "rolls" the die.

Thanks to the first part of this course, I learned the basics of Flutter and Dart: how to create a simple, yet fun app, how to use buttons, how to write Dart functions and use them accordingly and many more.

I'm more than excited to continue and finish this course to help me start a UI/UX Designer career!
